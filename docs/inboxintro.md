## Centralize all client communications.

> ### Navigating the Inbox:
> 
> **Inbox**: Any interaction with a client creates a thread here.
> 
> #### Main Inbox screen:
> - **Notifications** will show up here when you receive a new message, request or book an appointment.
> - **Bookings**  This will filter conversations chronologically so you can quickly see which appointments are coming up and access the info within the thread.
> - **Requests**  This filter shows you all unanswered requests.
> - **Pending**  This filter shows all pending booking links and approved requests that have not been completed by the client. 
>   - You can expire or extend the link by clicking the “Details” button within the thread.
> 
> #### Booking Links 
> Create Private booking links to share with clients in person or on other platforms where the conversation started. This is great for maintaining a personal connection with your clients rather than automating the whole process. Booking links allow the artist to fill in info that's already been discussed so the client can simply pay the deposit. Catch appointments wherever they naturally happen but keep your schedule in one organized place.
> 
> 1. Click **Booking Link** at the bottom right side of your **Inbox** 
> 2. Create a link for **Custom** work
>   - Fill out the details associated with the design.  
>   - **Duration** & **Deposit** are the most important 
>      - Duration will allow Flashbook to find a timeslot on your calendar that fits
> 3. Create a link for **Flash** 
>   - Simply pick the flash design your client wants
> 4. **Appointment time**
>   - **“Let the client choose from availability”** allows the client to pick a day/time that works for them within your chosen availability.
>   - **“Set date and time”** will allow you to override anything on your calendar and place an appointment wherever you want. **BE CAREFUL NOT TO DOUBLE BOOK YOURSELF!**
> 5. **Booking link expiration** allows you to select when a link should expire, so clients can’t surprise you a year later with a design you no longer want to do.
> 
> ### Accessing client info and Editing bookings:
> 
> #### Within a **Thread** in your **Inbox**:
> - All messages and changes to the appointment will be displayed chronologically.
> - **Client Info** that is collected from the booking form is displayed at the top of each thread.
> - **Details button** is where you can access more info and edit your appointments:
>   - **Contact Info:** Call, Text, or Email your client directly.
>   - **Reschedule:** Change date and time of appointment and automatically email the client about these changes.
>   - **Change Location:** Change the location of the appointment 
>   - **Change Artwork:** Change design if client has second thoughts
>   - **Notes:** leave yourself private notes to help remember key details about your appointment.
>   - **Archive Conversation:** if you don’t want to see this thread in your inbox anymore.
> 
> ### Benefits:
> #### Streamlined Communication:
> - All interactions and details in one place.
> #### Flexibility: 
> - It's not necessary to use Flashbook for every part of the booking process — but the calendar and inbox will help you stay organized and connected
