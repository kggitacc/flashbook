## Choose your scheduling and availability.

> ### Setting Up Your Calendar:
> 
> #### 1. Navigate to **Calendar** Tab:
> - Select a day and click “Add Availability”: Specify working hours (e.g., 12 PM – 8 PM).
>   - Adding one large chunk of time works best — Flashbook will place  appointments where they fit
>     - Flashbook uses the “Duration” of a design to optimize your calendar.
>   - You can “Add Break” if you need specific time off during your day.
> 
> - **Recurring Hours: **
>   - You can apply availability to multiple days by clicking the drop down arrow next to the **Save** button.
>     - **“Apply to every (Friday)”** will apply the availability to all Fridays. You can also set recurring hours by selecting the day of the week at the top of the calendar.
>     - **“Apply to Multiple Dates”** will allow you to select any dates on the calendar and duplicate your availability across all of them
> 
> #### 2. Customize Booking Windows:
> - Go to **Settings** icon at top right and scroll down to **Date Availability**
>   - **Fixed Date Range:** Set a specific booking window between 2 dates.
>     - Clients will only be able to book within these dates
>   - **Rolling Books:** Always show availability for the specified number of upcoming weeks.
>     - When set to “4 weeks”. Clients will only see the availability within 4 weeks of the current date. 
>     - This is helpful for setting recurring weekly hours but not letting clients book too far into the future.
> 
> #### 3. Set Time Slot Intervals:
> - Go to **Settings** icon at top right and scroll down to **Appointment Timing**
>   - Select a **Time Slot Interval** for how large of a slot you want the calendar to display to clients
>     - Choose a time that is roughly the **duration** of a typical tattoo.
>     - If you have an availability that is 12pm-8pm and choose 4 hour intervals, Flashbook will show clients 2 slots (12pm & 4pm) when the day is empty. These slots will shift to accommodate booked appointments to optimize your day.
> 
> #### 4. Manage Appointment Buffers:
> - Appointment Buffers: Add time between appointments.
>
