> ### Work Flashbook into your existing booking process:
> 
> #### Use Flashbook as your personal website
>   - If you don't have an existing website, Flashbook is an easy way to showcase your body of work and easily allow clients to contact and book with you.
> 
> #### Embed Flashbook into your existing website
>   - Maybe you already have a great looking website you spent a bunch of time building. Just add Flashbook to the “Booking” page of your website to allow clients to self book or contact you. Flashbook is a powerful organizational tool even if it's just handling the booking.
> 
> #### Send “Booking Links” 
>   - If you like starting conversations naturally in person or through DMs/Emails, just send your client a “booking link” once they’re ready to book. Just because you like talking to people doesn't mean you have to manually do everything else. Make it easy for you and your clients instead of chasing them for deposits.
